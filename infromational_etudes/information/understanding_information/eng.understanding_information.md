# Understanding term "information".

On of the most glaring examples of physical meaning of the term "information" - is the [Morse Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code). This is the combination of short and long signals arranged in certain order. Where every letter or number corresponds to a specific form of unique combination of short and long signals. For its parts, every signal should have own form and be following special rules:

* The length of a dot is one unit
* A dash is the three units
* The space between parts of the same letter is one unit
* The space between letters is three units
* The space between words is seven units

Physically information through Morse code transmitting by sequence of signal-pause values within special formation, where this special formation - is information. In case of radio - it's electromagnetic energy transformed into sound energy that is in special formation. In general, it's energy-in-formation.  

Why is it so?

So imagine the situation - you hear the incessant [sound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound)(mean [sound energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_energy)) of one tone without any interruption and pauses or you see continuous luminescence (mean [light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light) and [luminous energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luminous_energy)). From the point of view of "Morse Code" there are nothing about information yet, its juts flow of [energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy). 

But once:

* radio operator pushed button (physical energy of the hand or finger transformed into electromagnetic energy by button) formation is appearing because of other energy
* any object will be blocking the luminescence (any kind of energy that is requiring object to be moving and be blocking the luminescence) - formation is appearing because of other energy
* in case of [transistor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor) [electromagnetic energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy) that is powering on one  of  transistor contacts that is switching off/on the energy flow between two others and formation is appearing because of other energy

In case of you have first solid continuous energy flow, then you need second energy flow that will be periodically blocking first one and it will be process of creating formation that will be process of grating energy-in-formation. The human mostly care about formation because of importance but not about energy itself. Kind of energy might be different. The second energy source is the source of information.

In case of absence of solid continuous energy flow, in the void you can be using energy source like source of information by switching off/on.

Essentially, what is happening - is just flow dilution crated by another energy flow. Or in opposite way - it's just filling of the void by energy. But where the information presented will never be the 100% Ð¾f amount of energy, it will be less.

May be the best illustration of principles of creating information is the sign of "yin-yang". If you want to create information fill the environment with diluted energy, by diluting energy flow or filling of the void by energy portions.

The shortcut for this whole article might be this dialog:

    A: Why the information is information?
    B: Because the information - is the energy-in-formation.
    A: But why are we mentioning about the "in-formation" only?
    B: Because energy is energy, but the formation creating the forms within fixing it by formulas for being able to repeat actions with or making copy by another portion of energy ...

The same principle used in any IT technology by using transistors and magnetic sectors on HDD (partly it's described in this article ["Time for D? 2D? 3D? Even 500D or nD?"](https://github.com/alexandrkirilov/kirilov_articles/blob/master/unsorted/time_for_d/eng.time_for_d.md)).

You need to pay attention to the term ["Frequency"](https://github.com/alexandrkirilov/kirilov_articles/blob/master/unsorted/frequency/rus.frequency.md) ([Wiki definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency)) as well.

The same principle using by humans when recognising information from sounds by hearing and information from visual objects by eye, where the energy-in-formation is the sound or light and the formation is the schema of changing frequency of the energy flow.

There are a lot of details in schema of using one energy source for different sources of information that is delivering information for different clients. There are a lot of details described how to dilute 100% of energy to create energy-in-formation. And etc - but all of it the topics for other articles.
