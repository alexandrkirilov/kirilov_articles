# Informational etude: Nikola Tesla

The task: to write an informational etude (explanation) of the model based on memorials of Nikola Tesla.

The memorials of Nikola Tesla, the situation explanation:

The possibilities of will-power and self-control appealed tremendously to my vivid imagination, and I began to discipline myself. Had I a sweet cake or a juicy apple which I was dying to eat I would give it to another boy and go through the tortures of Tantalus, pained but satisfied. Had I some difficult task before me which was exhausting I would attack it again and again until it was done. So I practiced day by day from morning till night. At first it called for a vigorous mental effort directed against disposition and desire, but as years went by the conflict lessened and finally my will and wish became identical.

The informational etude.

For the first - we have be out of information. For the case of right recognition we have to exclude our own relation to the Nikola Tesla from this model. Our habitual imagination of him is the genius within unattainable abilities. This is first mistake for the case of this model. The property - genius, added to him only because of the results of his research actions, without results he is common human being and has own energy limits that have to be recharged by having meal, sleeping or getting rest or other properties.

The second point - somehow to define the key action. The Nikola Tesla is explaining by this memorial the method of achieving results, then key-phrase is: "Had I some difficult task before me which was exhausting I would attack it again and again until it was done." Based on this phrase and the key Tesla's function - researcher, might be supposed that this is the key function that is performed by the object that is named Nikola Tesla by parents. The key function: cyclical pattern matching (the pattern matching term based on previous articles, for better understanding need to read it) where the income pattern is what the Nicola Tesla get based on own fillings (the fillings recognition is out of topic of this article, we are getting it as it is) and trying to find the income pattern equality in real world by composing real world object by manipulators - hands, mean making electro-magnetic devices.

For the case of OOP (for procedural approach will get differences), based on previous we have an object Nicola_tesla that might to contain variables and methods:

* var Energy: the positive integer, values from 0 to infinity
* method Recharge_energy(): the function that is summing the current value of var Energy with another value provided by another method or function
* method Recharge_energy_by_sleep(): the inherited function from Recharge_energy() where the same functionality within another value for summing
* method Recharge_energy_by_meal(): the inherited function from Recharge_energy() where the same functionality within another value for summing
* method _self_destruct(): the method functionality is obvious, from the real life we got the fear of dying, but never the less - every kind of object or structure has this method from begin, it's kind of our nature rules, for the case of IT it's some kind of garbage collection, in the real world it is decomposition or decay
* method Find_pattern_equality(): the cyclical function of finding equality to income pattern from fillings in the real world by analysing the data from body's build-in-sensors: eyes, ears, nose and etc by composing the real world objects by manipulators - hands
* etc

That object's explanation might be more detailed. For the purpose of this article (to demonstrate of Informational Etude writing) it's enough.

Based on first-level analyses we have:

* an object that is performed cyclical action of pattern matching, where at the end of every cycle the value of var Energy became less on value of energy loss because of performed action
* when the value of Energy became equal 0 then start _self_destruct() function
* set the trigger for the critical level of var Energy for pausing cyclical function within keeping state for continuing and perform it further when value of Energy became not critical and start one of actions Recharge_energy_by_meal() or Recharge_energy_by_meal()

All of it in general - ideal situation when object Nicola_Tesla has no any disturbance from outside informational sources or inner mechanism or objects. In the real world there are always something interrupting.

All of any kind of disturbance from one side is always balanced by discipline and self-control from other side.

About discipline ...

Be turned back to dictionaries again:
* [discipline in oxforddictionaries.com](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/discipline)
* [discipline in merriam-webster.com](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/discipline)

The original word "discipulus" ([from Latin](http://latindictionary.wikidot.com/noun:discipulus))  - "student", that's why disciplines still studying in universities. This word got changes through the Middle Ages but it still has one of meanings - "A system of rules of conduct". The rule for object Nikola_Tesla is to continue the research function without any interruption. Let improve object Nikola_Tesla for the level of application distributed through the servers where function Find_pattern_equality() has highest priority and it's mean any other request or any income information from any other servers, users or any kind of sources will be denied or dropped out or the sources will be blocked. All of it looks like some kind of "firewall" that is allowing inner system do not spend the time and resources while primary function not finished. In turn, it makes possible to compress the time for the primary function because of absence any interruption and in turn to do more then any server that has got any interruption. As a result - the research achievements that is adding property "genius" to object Nikola_Tesla.

About a sweet cakes or a juicy apples ...

Just imagine the inner mechanism in the object Nikola_tesla. Some kind of mechanism like "Desire_keeper". In accordance to the real life any desire has functionality of _self_destruct(). This mechanism is allowing human body don't be overloaded endlessly by not realised desires that in turn make impossible human general functionality. By giving to anyone an apple or cake the object Nicola_tesla is making the task to Desire_keeper mechanism and cycle it to infinity by excluding the object of desire from functionality calculation, some sort of function that couldn't ever be done: "I want apple that I already gave to someone". From the first glance - it total absurd. For understanding it need to get out of mechanism for the upper level. Just imagine that "Desire_keeper" mechanism - is one of the list of mechanisms and there are presented controller of mechanisms that is setting priority for mechanisms, where one of parameters is list of unfinished tasks. By improving lists of unfinished task he is making any task from it more important then any other. On the contrary, inside of "Desire_keeper" any "apple_task" has lowest priority in turn any kind of research desire became the highest priority task through the whole system.
