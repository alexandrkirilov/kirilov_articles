The Informational Etude (IE) is the task for anyone who is going to be practised in describing real world issues for the case of modelling applications for future developing on any kind of programming language.

The definition is obvious, inherited from music and painting.

- From music: a short musical composition, typically for one instrument, designed as an exercise to improve the technique or demonstrate the skill of the player.
- From painting: an art, usually drawn with a view to research for the purpose of something bigger.

In both explanation: something small and rapid that is improving ability. Why etude is informational? Because of improving ability to recognise the information and the data objects and relations to each other within informational exchange.

Started to be used at time of lecturing "Theory of Information" like additional exercise for making students able to see real world issues on abstracted level. For most cases is extremely difficult to explain to them what is "in-general" and what is "specific" and what is "realisation".

Additionally to motivate the students based on famous persons experience.
