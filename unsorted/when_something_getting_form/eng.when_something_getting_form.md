# When something getting form and became in-formation.

The original meaning of "information" came from Latin, in accordance with Oxford Dictionary (https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/information) it looks like: 

late Middle English (also in the sense ‘formation of the mind, teaching’), via Old French from Latin informatio(n-), from the verb informare (see inform)

In it's turn the word "inform" mean, based on the same dictionary (https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/inform):

Middle English enforme, informe ‘give form or shape to’, also ‘form the mind of, teach’, from Old French enfourmer, from Latin informare ‘shape, fashion, describe’, from in- ‘into’ + forma ‘a form’

Look bellow for getting the list of key-points of all of this dictionary's explanations:

formation of the mind
give form or shape to
form the mind of, teach
from in- ‘into’ + forma ‘a form’
There are some kind of action that contained in all of this points. Let say it in other words: something that is taking reasonable and valuable form based on our own system of values (length and with, colors, sound power or something special for defined part of the science). If we have no system of values for any kind of analysis we are storing facts or events and trying to recognize the pattern of this facts or events, and after we are defining the system of values based on this pattern. We are defining form of the pattern.

And this process globally looks like infinity circled process. We are improving system of values and then trying to compare new ones.

For example lets look on possible situation when "Red color" became "Red color". From the Physics point of view any kind of color it's only electro-magnetic waves of a certain frequency and human body has the sensors - eyes, that is capable of recognizing the frequency of electro-magnetic waves and sending the frequency value to the brain where it will be compared to the previously created patterns and in result will be defined like "Red". 

Based on article from Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visible_spectrum), the red color it's only the waves of 480-484THz of frequency. The pattern "Red" mean - electro-magnetic waves of 480-484THz of frequency. While we have no spectrum gradation within defined pattern "Red", we don't able to recognize that "Red" is "Red", we only see something without anything precise.

By the way, all that we see - always the past. It might looks strange at the first glance, but if you will look carefully on the physical process of the light, light has the speed. It's mean there are always the time between ignition and the time of reacting on it by sensor (eye or any kind of device's sensor). Very small time, but never the less - time. Only that is inside of the system - is present, in our case human body. Funny coincidence that the present is about the time the same like about the gift, but this topic is outside this article.

Let be turned back to the information.

In following of previous the information became information like a result of some kind of pattern matching to what we've been gathering and analyzing before and if we have no enough of patterns we are creating new patterns first. Sometime is very important to care about of speed os pattern matching only, but sometime is more important to care about creating new patterns and spread it through matchers.

The dialog that might be like illustration for what is information itself:

A: Why the information is information?
B: Because the information - is energy-in-formation.
A: But why are we mentioning only about the "in formation" only?
B: Because energy is energy, but the forms is creating by using formulas that is describing what and how should be "in formation". In other direction, creating the forms and fixing it by formulas for being able to repeat action or making copy within another portion of energy ...
