# The Frequency

In one of previous articles (["Spiralnoyes"](https://github.com/alexandrkirilov/kirilov_articles/blob/master/unsorted/spiralnoyes/eng.spiralnoyes.md)) - mentioned about the time, that is only timeline allowing to recognise the sequence that containing information. In the example with the Morse code mentioned about 1 second like period for checking the state of the sources on or off. This, in turn, means that we are every 1 second checking the state of the transmitter, "on" or "off". 

For the case of basis metrics:

1 time per second when the basis metric 1 second
60 times per minute when the basis metric 1 minute
3600 times per hour when the basis metric 1 hour
Based on dictionaries, the ["frequency"](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/frequency) mean: 

Uncountable noun: The frequency of an event is the number of times it happens during a particular period;
Variable noun: In physics, the frequency of a sound wave or a radio wave is the number of times it vibrates within a specified period of time.
The physical meaning of it briefly might be read in [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency) or in other specially purposed for studying Physics.

For this topic is important to care about "an event is the number of times it happens during a particular period". In case of Morse code, it means the event - switching on the state of the source of information (transmitter or lamp or something else).

In other words all of it might look like we are switching on the lamp and we have to open eyes at the same time because if we not synchronise eyes opening to source we will get another information. Need to be noticed that not wrong information, only another information. Wrong or not wrong is only matching to something that is based on our own patterns, nothing more then it. But what if our eyes only some kind of another version of application that is working on another frequency?

If the user of information capable to get the state of the source only one time at second it doesn't mean that source capable for the same only. During 1 second the source might to send huge amount of information but the user will not get it because of closed eyes.

This picture is demonstrating how one information might be transformed to another only because of differences in source frequency and user frequency. The source is sending: "dot-dash-dot-dash" but the user is getting only "dash".

For the case of different sources to one user - "the frequency" might be used like metronome for musicians or conductor for an orchestra.
