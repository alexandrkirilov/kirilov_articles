# Time Machine

When we are mentioning "time machine", most likely we want to change something in the past for getting something different in the present or we want to see the future present based on the course of events realisation started from present for making decision in present for getting future present that we want to get.

The previous phrase is looking a little strange at the first glance. It's been written especially for illustrating total exclusion of the term "time" from any calculation. We should be concentrated on what is around. We have to be concentrated on environment around ourselves in the present. Because only thus things is rising the decision to change something. It might be table, chair, cat, car  and etc. Thus objects might to commit acts: chair stands by table, cat is jumping on the table, car goes and etc.

We are making decision about where to be focused our own energy based on the datum that we gathered by vision, hearing, tactile sensation and etc. from the space around us, in the range of our sensors eye, ear, nose and etc.

You will never make a decision "jump across deep creek" when you are staying at the middle of a street and eating ice cream. For making decision "jump across deep creek" at least you have to be followed somewhere for something and be gotten a creek that is crossing your path, that is rising necessity "jump across deep creek", and you will do it now, when you get creek crossed the path. Not in future, not in the past. You will act only now.

What does it mean "jump across deep creek" from the informational point of view? It's changing position one objects towards another object on the path that is previously calculated based on necessity to be followed somewhere for something. In other words one object - you, changed you position towards another object - creek by the acting "jump across". The creek was ahead of you and became behind of you like result of action.

Before action "jump" you've been choosing the place for jump by recognising properties of the objects in the environment around you in conjunction to the path:

- the place for jump should be not too far from the path, because of energy loosing for getting it after jump for moving body
- at the place of jump the width of the creek has to be less then maximal value of you body abilities for jumping based on the experience of jumping collected before it

This jump-example might be considered like technical specification for the time machine calculation for illustrating of what happened if I jumped across. Some sort of where I will and what state I will get at the and of this action - when I jumped across. Some sort of preliminary calculation, sort of modelling the situation that we are usually do when projecting something.

Inside of this calculation nothing about time, everything about the objects and theirs states and the actions that is changing states: the width of creek, the value of your own abilities for jumping, energy consumption for action and etc.

All of calculation is about the world around us and the objects that is included to it within actions that this objects performing right now to each other. Every failed attempt of the jump will require to improve the maximal available value for jump, every wrong chosen place, where the location of jumps to far from path will improve mechanism of choosing the place in case of path, every wrongly chosen value of the power of the contraction of the muscles will improve it and etc. It looks like circle of calculation when every round is improving ability when it calculated in conjunction to tendency that is fallowing us for getting positive result. And beside to the calculation of the object that is included to the situation there have to be analysed relation of every object in the calculation towards any outside objects connected to it and this outside object might to change the state of objects inside of calculation when it calculating. For example when you calculating the level of the water in creek might became poor because of drought at the any place located on the distance of 1000km from the place of jump and the necessity to jump across might be canceled because of it.

For the case of simplicity of understanding it better to visualise the situation when you are pined to the position and space within objects is moving towards you and only taking from you some points of your energy. For example not you jumping across the creek, but the creek is moving beneath your foots and taking from you some points of energy for performing this rebuilding the environment around you. It might looks like any computer game, when you are siting in the chair and looking at monitor and the space (but this space is restricted by abilities of datum handling and calculating of the computer and the developers that is supplied it by software and hardware). In case of your death you will start this game within iterative improved values for behaviour inside of game environment.

The example with jumping across creek - the example of future calculation, the example within game restart is about changing formulas and datum for calculation for getting preferred present state of the objects.

Why are we desiring the "time machine"? The reply for this question is inside of energy consumption. We have the limit of energy capacity and always trying to reduce consumption. It looks like a solution for saving our own energy for something else. We don't want to loose the energy for self supply when we drying the clothes after falling into the water and because of undressed state of the body we don't able to continue moving forward. We don't want to loose more energy for being back to the path after choosing the place of jump and other and other. All about our own limits and attempt to reduce energy consumption for performing action.

We got to be getting closely to the definition of technical requirements for developing mechanism named like "time machine".  It might looks like:

We need to develop some kind of machine that will be capable of gathering information about environment for the level of physical particles, gathering information about abilities to perform actions by thus objects towards each other and rebuild physically the space by performing every object in the space.

It looks a little unreal. But! We've already done the first step to it. The version control systems (SVN, Git and others) - it's the first step that is allowing us to develop it in future. For now we are only trying to teach machines to be able storing formulas of objects reproducing. And if something wrong we are only assign the branch from the point where everything good, good by our own opinion (it's very important point for understanding). Looks like parallel reality. But we still not good in analysing and rebuilding data that is stored before based on another version of formulas (The Big Data Analysis problem). I am not sure about physics, but we still trying to build molecules from particle by demand.

There might be main rule for building "time machine":

We have no any differences on the level of physical particles, we all builded by it, there are only few of it. There only differences in schema of connection between this particles and this structure is the information (formula) of how to build it.

After all that written, couple of questions:

- Who is building machines? The human? Yes.
- Is there ability for programming anything that hasn't been analysed, reasoned by the human? No, it's not possible. Might be better to start things more about human's abilities then about "time machine"?
