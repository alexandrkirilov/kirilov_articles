The type of informational source is always defines the format of information. On the physical level there are only two types of informational sources:

- Active informational source - this source is producing energy that is delivering information. The examples: the Sun or Nuclear reactor
- Passive informational source: this source is using energy from any other sources and by the transformation, or distortion, or misrepresentation delivering the information to the consumer. The simplest example: painting or drawing.

Both of it is basis for understanding of the formats of any kind of information.

Look on few examples:

- The paper and the drawing. The passive informational source that is using the electromagnetic energy in a range of human eye ability for delivering information. On the physical level it looks like full or semi blocking or distortion of original light energy in the defined consistency, where this consistency is the information. The blocking and distortion appeared after spreading the pigments particles through the paper. This is the basis for the format of the information: the schema of pigment spreading through the paper for every point of the paper, where the limits of this format will be always dependable on physical properties of the pigments and paper for the case of light energy.
- The monitor and the drawing. Just the same way, this is the passive informational source that is using the electromagnetic energy in a range of human eye ability for delivering information. But, the energy transformation schema is more complicated. In principle it looks like transforming electricity to the light energy for an attempt to achieve the ability to deliver visual information, painting or drawing. This kind of type will always be dependable on monitor ability to produce the light in special manner (the limits of RGB).
- The disk of the HDD. This is passive informational source that is not producing energy too. It's transforming electricity to the sequence if electricity signal based on sequence of magnetic sectors on discs. This sequence is the format for delivering information. For this case the format will be always dependable on physical properties of electricity and magnetic abilities of the materials that discs produced.
- The HDD's reader head. It's passive informational source too towards to disk, because it's transforming electricity to magnetic energy and the result of it the direction of magnetics fields in sectors on the disc. Always dependable on physical properties of electricity and magnetic abilities of the materials that discs and head produced.

Some informational sources might be a consumers too. The HDD the first example. The HDD is the source at time of reading and at time of writing it is the consumer. If there switched electricity off the HDD became the storage.

Any kind of passive informational source or any kind of active source within switched energy spreading out off - became the informational storage. The paper within drawing or text (the text is drawing too, in a special manner only) without light energy is only storage and became active at time of focusing on it the light energy. The HDD without electrical energy is only storage too, if you need to get any information from this source at first you have to supply it by electricity. Any person or any individual towards to you the informational storage while you not asking him or any other events do not provoke himself to spend his own energy for delivering any kind of information from his own storages to you or any other by waving the airs molecules (voice based formats: speech or singing), by changing the light by manipulators spreading pigments (painting or drawing) or any other. In some cases the informational storage might be totally dependable on energy and if energy flow blocked or switched off the information going to be deleted totally.
